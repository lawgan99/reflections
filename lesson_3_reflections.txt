When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that we are sure the changes at local is what we want to share at the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork - cloning repository at GitHub but still retaining reference to the original repository. Use when do not have permission on the original repository and still want to have reference to it.
    Clone - cloning repository between GitHub-GitHub, GitHub-Local. Use when just want to have a copy to make changes and test out.
    Branch - Branch out in the repository to continue testing different scenrio while the master continue to be updated. Use when want to test out different code/scenario but do not want to make the change on the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    So that when remote is not accessible, can still determine what has been push to the remote based on remote copy on local.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    Talk, chat, message, email. It is easier as there is personal communication which can make clarification faster. It is harder as not all the time people can communicate at the same time.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Make changes in a separate branch when want to test out different scenario while not impacting master.
